Fix My Code Challenge

🧰 Jump into an existing codebase and… fix it!
This project is about debugging and repairing existing code (sometimes in languages you don’t know yet). The goal is not to rewrite everything, but to fix what’s broken.

🎯 Background

Sometimes you’ll know the language, sometimes you won’t — that’s part of the challenge.
Download the repository Fix_My_Code_Challenge and use it as the starting point for all your fixes.

ℹ️ 100% optional: Completing any part can add a project grade above 100% to your average. Not doing it won’t hurt your average, but if your current average is higher than your grade here, it might go down slightly. Have fun!

✅ Requirements

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

Target environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

All files must end with a newline

A root-level README.md is mandatory
